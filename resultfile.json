However I split my answer into 2 parts the first part explains how to use an open source package to solve your problem, the second part helps you out if you want to do private keys signing.</p>\n\n<h2>Using a package</h2>\n\n<p>There are a couple of php packages that support JWT signing, at the moment of writing the one that is used most is <strong>lcobucci/jwt</strong>, but there are also other implementations found here:\n<a href=\"https://packagist.org/search/?q=jwt\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://packagist.org/search/?q=jwt</a></p>\n\n<p>You can use <a href=\"https://getcomposer.org\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">composer</a> to install it. Since version 4.0 is not documented right now I suggest you install 3.2 and have a look at the <a href=\"https://github.com/lcobucci/jwt/blob/3.2/README.md\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">README</a> file of that version.</p>\n\n<p>You can require this in your project using: <code>composer require lcobucci/jwt:^3.2</code></p>\n\n<p>Your code sample suggests you need RSA256, the library has an example for that:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\nuse Lcobucci\\JWT\\Builder;\nuse Lcobucci\\JWT\\Signer\\Keychain; // just to make our life simpler\nuse Lcobucci\\JWT\\Signer\\Rsa\\Sha256; // you can use Lcobucci\\JWT\\Signer\\Ecdsa\\Sha256 if you're using ECDSA keys\n\n$signer = new Sha256();\n$keychain = new Keychain();\n$token = (new Builder())\n    -&gt;setIssuer('http://example.com') // Configures the issuer (iss claim)\n    -&gt;setAudience('http://example.org') // Configures the audience (aud claim)\n    -&gt;setId('4f1g23a12aa', true) // Configures the id (jti claim), replicating as a header item\n    -&gt;setIssuedAt(time()) // Configures the time that the token was issue (iat claim)\n    -&gt;setNotBefore(time() + 60) // Configures the time that the token can be used (nbf claim)\n    -&gt;setExpiration(time() + 3600) // Configures the expiration time of the token (nbf claim)\n    -&gt;set('uid', 1) // Configures a new claim, called \"uid\"\n    -&gt;sign($signer,  $keychain-&gt;getPrivateKey('file://{path to your private key}')) // creates a signature using your private key\n    -&gt;getToken(); // Retrieves the generated token\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Signing and verifying</h2>\n\n<p>When using public and private keys you always have to be sure to keep your private key safe. You can however easily publish your public key to the world without compromising security.</p>\n\n<p>Signing is done using the private key, since you don't want people to be able to fake your signature, signing with the public part would make it possible for everyone to do it. This also means that the verify step always uses the public key, because everyone should be able to do it.</p>\n\n<h2>Doing it in PHP</h2>\n\n<p>The code example you provided simply loads a private key, but does not do any action with it. In order to sign you will need to use <code>openssl_sign</code> with your variable. <code>Resource #xx</code> simply means a reference to something external in php.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n// Data to sign\n$payload = 'TEST';\n// Generate a new key, load with: openssl_pkey_get_private\n$privateKey = openssl_pkey_new(array('private_key_bits' =&gt; 512)); // NOT SECURE BUT FAST\n// Extract public part from private key\n$details = openssl_pkey_get_details($privateKey);\n// Use openssl_pkey_get_public to load from file\n$publicKey = $details['key'];\n\n// Generated by openssl_sign\n$signature = null;\n// Sign with private key\nopenssl_sign($payload, $signature, $privateKey, OPENSSL_ALGO_SHA256);\n\n// Use base64 because the signature contains binairy data\necho 'Signed data: '.base64_encode($signature).PHP_EOL;\n\n// Use publicKey to verify signature\n$valid = openssl_verify($payload, $signature, $publicKey, OPENSSL_ALGO_SHA256);\necho 'Signature is '.($valid ? 'Valid' : 'Invalid').PHP_EOL;\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>What else</h2>\n\n<p>If you still want to implement the complete protocol I suggest you have another look at the package. And as already suggested by the comments the complete specification:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519.txt\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519.txt</a></p>\n\n<p>Last hint: JWT uses some different characters for base64 than php so be sure to handle that correctly.</p>\n"},{"owner":{"reputation":636,"user_id":2894210,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/cVlcx.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rajesh Manilal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2894210/rajesh-manilal"},"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1491546783,"creation_date":1491546783,"answer_id":43271181,"question_id":43253959,"body":"<p>With respect to @Miguel-F's comment, I've surfed and found a solution from <a href=\"https://www.bennadel.com/blog/934-ask-ben-handling-redirects-with-coldfusion-cfhttp.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Ben Nadel&#39;s post\">Ben Nadel's post</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I've got 200 as response, this is because ColdFusion followed the redirect to dl.boxcloud.com (since by default, the REDIRECT attribute is TRUE), and the redirected request's response is 200. </p>\n\n<p>Actually we should stop the redirect by setting REDIRECT attribute to <code>FALSE</code>.

However, it might cause problems if not properly encoded when sent in the body of the HTTP request, which is expected to be <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>. The '+', for example, will decode to a space which will be ignored by many base64 decoders. The description in the error you're seeing doesn't seem to line up with that being the problem but it will corrupt the data and be a problem at some point (unless maybe you are url encoding the parameter values and just showing them unencoded in the question). Using base64url rather than base64 will mean that the value of the assertion <code>parameter</code> doesn't need to be url encoded and won't get messed up during url decoding.
