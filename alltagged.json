We have a production environment where as once we are finished working with files our production software system zips them up and saves them into a local server directory for archival purposes. This local path cannot be changed. My question is how can I programmatically upload these files to our Box.com account so we can archive these on the cloud? Everything I've read regarding this involves using OAuth2 to gain access to our account which I understand but it also requires the user to login.

I'd like to use one address for production (e.g., <a href=\"https://my_site.com/box_redirects_here\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://my_site.com/box_redirects_here</a>), one for ongoing development (<a href=\"http://localhost:8000/box_redirects_here\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://localhost:8000/box_redirects_here</a>) and one for automatic UI tests (<a href=\"http://localhost:8001/box_redirects_here\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://localhost:8001/box_redirects_here</a>). As far as I could see, the only way to do that would be to create three different Box applications - is there an easier way? BTW, both Dropbox and Google Drive do support multiple redirect URIs. </li>\n<li>I have a set of automatic tests that I'd like to run a few times a day. The challenge I'm facing is that every time I run these tests, my refresh_token is invalidated, and I can't use it again - which means I can't run the same set of tests a few hours later without manually getting a new token. One solution would be to save the refresh token, for example in a file, so I could reuse it across testing sessions. But: \n<ul>\n<li>It's really cumbersome. </li>\n<li>if different developers are running these tests from different machines with no common file system that doesn't really work. </li>\n<li>Again, for whatever reason this doesn't seem to be an issue with Google Drive or with Dropbox. </li>\n</ul></li>\n</ol>\n"},{"tags":["php","curl","box-api"],"owner":{"reputation":240,"user_id":1017963,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ba9be360cd08628ca8400fb2c354db1b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dave","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1017963/dave"},"is_answered":false,"view_count":642,"answer_count":1,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1437742294,"creation_date":1437640508,"question_id":31582173,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31582173/uploading-files-to-box-using-v2-api","title":"uploading files to BOX using v2 API","body":"<p>I'm trying to upload a file to box using curl, I can create and view folders but not upload a file.</p>\n\n<p>According to the documentation the curl request is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>curl https://upload.box.com/api/2.0/files/content \\\n-H \"Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN\" -X POST \\\n-F attributes='{\"name\":\"tigers.jpeg\", \"parent\":{\"id\":\"11446498\"}}' \\\n-F file=@myfile.jpg\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I'm using this method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public function put_file($filename, $name, $parent_id) {\n$url = $this-&gt;upload_url .

But as far as I can determine, Box offers no other venue for developer questions/concerns than this site.</p>\n\n<p>The page <a href=\"http://developers.box.com/docs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://developers.box.com/docs/</a> under \"Authorize\" has the example:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Example URL</p>\n  \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.box.com/api/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&amp;client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&amp;redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.box.com/api/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&amp;client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&amp;redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI</a></p>\n  \n  <p>Example Callback</p>\n  \n  <p>YOUR_REDIRECT_URI?code=THE_AUTHORIZATION_CODE</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If I use XMLHttpRequest (see code below*) with the example URL, I get a response that contains the HTML of the \"This app requires that you log in to your Box account\" page.  I save the HTML document and open it in the browser.  When the user supplies the password and clicks \"Log in\" the \"This app is requesting permissions to access your Box account\" page appears.  When the \"Allow\" button is clicked, the page is re-directed to the \"YOUR_REDIRECT_URI\" in the example above.</p>\n\n<p>Ok ... now what?  How does my app (a Firefox extension) access the \"YOUR_REDIRECT_URI?code=THE_AUTHORIZATION_CODE\" string?  It's just sitting in the location bar of my browser.  Even if my redirect_url is a valid url that executes some php or cgi script that extracts the authorization code from the url, how is my extension code supposed to retrieve it?  The extension is all client-side JavaScript.  Why do I need to bother with re-direct urls at all?  The user supplies their box username/password to my extension during setup.  OAuth 2 provides a \"password\" grant type which can be used to exchange a username and password for an access token directly.  Can't box support a token request like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>POST https://www.box.com/api/oauth2/token\n   grant_type=password&amp;\n   username=USERNAME&amp;\n   password=PASSWORD&amp;\n   client_id=CLIENT_ID\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This would eliminate the need to authorize the user completely.  The fact that the user has already supplied his username/password to my extension implies authorization.  Making the redirect_url mandatory puts undue obligations to small-time developers like myself.  Do I have to maintain and pay for a secure domain to handle the thousands (or even hundreds of thousands) of XMLHttpRequests per day?  My Firefox extensions are Open Source and free to anyone.  I do not have the resources to pay for that kind of overhead.  I offer box support in my extensions as a convenience to my users.  Box offers no incentive to do this (there is no longer even an affiliate program that rewards developers sending customers their way).</p>\n\n<p>Also, it appears that box does not (yet) support tags in the new API.

If anyone can help and even expose me to some good articles or tutorials on how to do this, that would be great!</p>\n\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n"},{"tags":["box-api","boxapiv2"],"owner":{"reputation":38,"user_id":4833920,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d7375902bb5cd6f898c9b9653f9cab16?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Or Bar Yaacov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4833920/or-bar-yaacov"},"is_answered":true,"view_count":349,"accepted_answer_id":38580220,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1469500606,"creation_date":1468405147,"question_id":38348893,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38348893/box-api-choosing-authentication","title":"BOX API - Choosing Authentication","body":"<p>I'm writing a backend application which will connect to an enterprise's box and should be able to access (get info, download content, search, get events about)  all content in the enterprise.</p>\n\n<p>I tried reading the following over and over:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.box.com/docs/configuring-box-platform\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://docs.box.com/docs/configuring-box-platform</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.box.com/docs/app-auth\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://docs.box.com/docs/app-auth</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.box.com/docs/app-users\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://docs.box.com/docs/app-users</a></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If I understand correctly, I would like to use <strong>App Auth</strong> so that no real user's credentials in the organization will be used in my app.</p>\n\n<p>Also I think that a <strong>user access token</strong> should be sufficient for my needs as long as it will have access to the entire enterprise's content.</p>\n\n<p>So my questions are :</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>In order to create an App User I seem to need to first get an Enterprise Access Token and then use it to create the App User using a POST request?\nCan't this be done via the GUI once per an enterprise?</p></li>\n<li><p>Am I right that a user access token is sufficient for my needs and it will give access to the whole organization's content?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","box-api","box"],"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":6742120,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b5b3d7633b4bf37e70a6218d950422d7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user6742120","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6742120/user6742120"},"is_answered":false,"view_count":250,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1478068434,"creation_date":1471844983,"question_id":39072124,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39072124/how-to-create-shared-link-in-box-using-java-sdk","title":"How to create shared link in box using java sdk","body":"<p>Can any one help me on how to create shared link in BOX using java SDK.
